*RevealExtends.txt* A plugin to reveal extended URLs from the buildout cache

===============================================================================
1. Introduction

Developers can use zc.buildout to manage the build of a software project. It
is most commonly used in the Zope and Plone world, but has been gaining
traction in other communities like Django.

One of the nice things about buildout is the ability to define the
configuration via ini style files. You can extend a local file or a URL. In
version 1.4.0 of buildout, the option to cache the URL locally was added along
with the new download API.

Here is an example: >

    [buildout]
    versions = versions
    extends = 
       http://dist.example.org/versions.cfg
       versions.cfg

>

This allows you to pull in a list of versions from example.org. If you have
your default.cfg setup to cache the URL then you could find that file
manually. This requires that you know the md5 hash of the URL string. Not the
most convenient way to find the file. This is where the plugin comes in
handy.

The plugin allows you to use the current line, a visual selection or a string
passed in to get the contents of the extended URL.

2. Notes
                                                                 *extends-cache*

In order for this plugin to work, you will need to set up your buildout to
cache downloaded URLs. This can be done by setting the appropriate option in
your buildout default.cfg. Here is an example: >

    $ mkdir -p ~/.buildout/extends
    $ cd ~/.buildout
    $ cat default.cfg
    [buildout]
    extends-cache = /home/clayton/.buildout/extends

>

Buildout does not currently expand the tilde, so you have to provide an
absolute path to the directory that will contain the cached files. You also
have to create the directory or you will receive an error.

===============================================================================
3. Commands

The plugin comes with one command called RevealExtends.

:RevealExtends [<extended_url>]                                 *:RevealExtends*

This command takes a url and looks for the corresponding cache file. If the
cache file does not exist, the plugin will attempt to access the URL directly.
Downloading the URL requires vim to be compiled with Python support.

The URL can be provided in one of three ways.

  1. Calling :RevealExtends with no arguments and no visual selection will
  use the entire current line you are on. Whitespace and new lines will be
  stripped. This will work when the URL is on a line by itself.

  2. You can use |visual-mode| to select the URL, then call
  :RevealExtends.
  
  3. The URL can be passed directly on the command line >
     :RevealExtends http://dist.example.org/versions.cfg
>

If the |extends-cache| does not exist or the file cannot be found, a message
will be given to the user.
